## About The Project

The goal of this project was to develop a robust and intuitive automation system for small to medium-sized bus travel companies. Traditional ticketing processes can be slow and prone to errors. This application solves that problem by providing a centralized system where an administrator or ticket agent can manage all aspects of the booking process quickly and efficiently.

The application is built with a focus on practical, real-world functionality, making it a powerful tool for any transportation business.

## Key Features

* **Bus & Route Selection:** Allows the administrator to easily browse and select from a list of available bus routes and schedules.
* **Interactive Seat Map:** Features a visual and interactive seat layout for each bus, showing available, occupied, and selected seats in real-time, preventing double-booking.
* **Passenger Data Management:** A straightforward form for entering and managing customer details (name, contact info, etc.) for each ticket.
* **End-to-End Booking Workflow:** Simulates the complete process of a real-world ticket counter, from initial customer inquiry to final booking confirmation and ticket generation.
* **Administrator-Focused Interface:** The UI is designed for speed and efficiency, allowing the clerk to serve customers without unnecessary delays.

## Technologies Used

This project is a desktop application developed using the Microsoft technology stack.

* **Core Language:** **C#**
* **Framework:** **.NET Framework** or **.NET**
* **User Interface:** **Windows Forms (WinForms)** or **WPF**
* **Database:** Likely uses a database such as **SQL Server** or **SQLite** for data persistence (e.g., storing routes, bookings, and customer information).
